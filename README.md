# Website Hosting in AWS (Amazon Web Services)
This repository contains screenshots in the form of a document about implementing static website hosting on the cloud platform AWS. This is my first hands-on project on the AWS console, after successfully achieving the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01).](https://www.credly.com/earner/earned/badge/35687239-c7fb-4d31-abec-39e0f10252f5) The project involves the use of several AWS services such as:
- S3
- EC2
- Certificate Manager
- Cloud Front
- Route53

PS: The credentials for the AWS account were provided to me by [Vighnesh Prakash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vighneshpp/)
